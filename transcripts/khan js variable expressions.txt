We're back with Winston, 
and now we have both a X and a Y variable for Winston's position.
So now we can make winston hop up and down and have a little Winston party! Wooo!
Very nice. Let's review what this code does before we keep going.
We have these X and Y variables at the top that store the center position of Winston's face,
which we use in this line here when we make the ellipse for his face.
Then, we position the eyes and the mouth relative to the center of the face
So we subtract or add to X and Y in order to make sure that the eyes are 50 pixels away or 100 pixels away.
For example, the mouth is 50 pixels to the right of the center of the face
And 40 pixels below the center of the face.
So let's go through and see what else we can store as variables.
To do that, I'm going to go through each line of the code 
and look for what we call hard coded numbers.
Those are numbers that are just straight numbers, not variables or dependent on variables.
Let's see. In our first ellipse call here, we hvae 300 and 300 for the width and height.
So we can make a variable for these instead, like faceSize.
So faceSize equals 300, 
and then we can pass faceSize in here and right now it would pass 300 as the value.
Cool. Now let's keep going.
Everything in here is using X or Y or eyeSize, 
but here for the mouth we once again have 150 and 150 for the width and height.
So we can make a mouth size variable, say mouthSize equals 150
And we'll go pass mouthSize here. 
And it'll just pass 150 right now because that's what the variable is equal to.
Ok, so now that we've done that we can easily change the face size here
And we can easily change the mouth size, and we can move it like that
And we can change the eye size again
Ok, so that's cool. But there's something I don't really like about that.
And that's when I change the face size,
I actually want everything else to change relative to the face size
So if I make the face size really small like this, 
I want his eyes and his mouth to be really small too.
If I make the face size half of its original size, 
the eyes and the mouth should also be half of their size. 
Otherwise he just looks really silly,
because his eyes and his mouth are way too big for his face.
They're not even connected anymore.
So what we want to do is somehow make these variables, 
mouthSize and eyeSize, be dependent on this variable, faceSize.
So let's bring it back to what it was.
So the way we can do this is we can make these values be based off the face size values.
So we can say mouthSize equals faceSize over two.
So we are using a fraction of the face, we're saying take one half of the face size.
And if you're not familiar with fractions, there's tons of videos on Khan Academy
That you can use to review how fractions work.
Alright, now for eye size it's around face size divided by four.
it's not perfect, but it's pretty good. Oh, seven.
There we go, that's better.
See, if you get the fraction wrong at first, you can always fix it later.
Just fiddle with that number until something makes sense.
Ok, so now if we resize the face again, 
see how the eyes and the mouth are actually resizing along with it?
It's pretty cool.
But there's still something wrong.
The eyes and the mouth are still going off the face when we go really small.
The sizes are correct, the problem is the offset from the face.
What's happening here is that down here when we position the ellipses
We have X minus 50 and Y minus 50, and then X plus 100 and Y minus 60
So even if our face size is only 50 pixels, 
we're still having the eye position at minus 50 pixels to the center,
which is going to make it off the face.
So we need for 50 to 100 and all these numbers here
All of these should also be fractions of the face size, 
so that when the face size changes the amount
That the eyes are offset and the mouth is offset, those numbers should also change.
So to show you what I mean, let's do the first eye.
X minus 50. So X minus 50 pixels.
This means it should be 50 pixels to the left of the center of the face.
Well, what we actually want now is to use the fractions.
So it's going to be face size divided by 6.
So one sixth the size of the face.
Cool. And then 50 will be also face size over 6.
So now if we resize, notice how that eye is perfectly positioned.
Good eye, Winston! Good eye.
The other eye still needs some help though
So 100, that'll be face size over 3, so one third the size of the face.
And 60 is one fifth the size of the face, so face size over 5.
Great. Let's resize it, very nice.
We still have a problem with our mouth.
So we'll go down to the mouth.
This one is maybe faceSize over six again
And this one is about faceSize over seven.
Alright, now everything is done proportionally. Let's check it out.
Woo. Now we can make Winston really small
And his eyes and mouth are still inside his face!
I'm sure Winston is really happy about that.
Alright! Yay.
So let's review what we're doing here.
At the top, we have our variables.
We start off with a variable that's just storing a number, 200.
Then we make our mouthSize and eyeSize variables be dependent on that number
As fractions of that number, so that if faceSize is currently 200
Then mouthSize will be 100.
But if we change faceSize to 300, then mouthSize would suddenly be 150
So it's always changing in proportion
Then, down here, when we calculate our offsets, we're also using fractions
Because we want the offsets to also be changing proportional to the face size.
We basically just want to make it so we just have this one variable that affects everything.
We can do that with variables and variable expressions.
So, now that we understand how to make variables dependent on other variables
We can do way more with our programs.
Let's celebrate by making Winston huuuuuuge!
Go Winston, come on, keep going! Keep going!
Neeever stop!! Keep going! Gnaaaaaa!

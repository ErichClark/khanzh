		Think about your house, or your school building, or your work office. There's a lot of repeating elements - especially on the outside. In this project, you'll use loops to add repeating elements to this house:<br>
		
	<p> 

	<ol>
		<li> Draw a window, then use a for loop to draw a row of windows (or, use nested for loops to make multiple rows of windows).<br> </li>
		<li> Draw a row of grass in front. And maybe some bushes or flowers?<br> </li>
		<li> The house is a plain color now. Use loops to make it a brick house or a house with "siding" or a log cabin. Check the images library for ways to make that more realistic.<br> </li>
		<li> Use a conditional inside a for loop to make more interesting grass or walls, so that you use a different color every other execution of the loop (hint: use the % operator).<br> </li>
	</ol>
	
	<p class="objective">
		Keep going! What else could you draw with loops?<br>

		<h1><i class="fa fa-star-o fa-3x"></i>Challenge: H is for Hopper</h1>
		<p class="objective">
			Hopper is our beaver that guides you through challenges. 
			Make her happy by drawing an &#34;H&#34;!
		</p>
		<h2>Step 1: Start the H!</h2>
		<p><img src="../images/002_h1.png" title="goal image"></p>
		<p>
			To draw an H using rectangles, we need two tall ones on the side and a short 
			one connecting them in the middle. Start the first side by typing in exactly the code below.
		</p> 
		<pre class="prettyprint">
rect(80, 70, 60, 240);
		</pre>
		<h2>Step 2: Now, the right side.</h2>
		<p><img src="../images/002_h2.png" title="goal image"></p>
		<p class ="objective">
			For the right side of the H, we want a rectangle that's exactly the same as the left side, except for the x position. 
			Not sure how to get started? You could just copy the same code that you wrote for step 1, and then try changing the x 
			(the first number) until the second rectangle is on the right hand side.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
rect(80, 70, 60, 240);
rect(<span class="boxorange">     </span>, 70, 60, 240);
		</pre>
		<h2>Step 3: Connect the sides!</h2>
		<p><img src="../images/002_h3.png" title="goal image"></p>
		<p class="objective">
			Now add a rect() command after the first two rect()s. The final rect() command will connect the sides with a 
			rectangle in the middle, completing our 'H'. Not sure what numbers to use for this rectangle? Try drawing it 
			on a sheet of paper, or just make up random numbers at first, and change them after until it looks like a middle.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
rect(80, 70, 60, 240);
rect(<span class="boxorange">     </span>, 70, 60, 240);
rect(140, 170, <span class="boxpink">     </span>, <span class="boxblue">     </span>);

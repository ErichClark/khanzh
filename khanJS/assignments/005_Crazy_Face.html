		<h1><i class="fa fa-star-o fa-3x"></i>Challenge: CRAZY Face</h1>
		<p class="objective">
			Let's make this face CRAZY! All we have to do is use what we learned about ellipses in Intro to Drawing.
		</p>
		
		<h2><img src="">
		Step 1: BIG mouth!</h2>
		<p class ="objective">
			This face is made of four ellipse()s, and the last one draws the mouth. Make the mouth ellipse at least 
			120 pixels wide and 40 pixels tall! (But don't move it yet!) You can type in new numbers or click a 
			number and use the 'number scrubber' to change them. Remember that the 2nd to last argument to ellipse() 
			is the width, and the last argument is the height.
		</p> 
		<pre class="prettyprint">
ellipse(195, 145, <span class="boxorange">     </span>, <span class="boxpink">     </span>);
		</pre>
		
		<h2><img src=" ">
		Step 2: TALL eyes!</h2>
		<p class ="objective">
			Make the eyes at least 60 pixels tall! Maybe even make them different sizes! (But don't move them yet!) 
			You can type in new numbers or click a number and use the 'number scrubber' to change them. Remember 
			that height is the last argument to ellipse().
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
ellipse(160, 170, 30, <span class="boxorange">     </span>);
ellipse(235, 170, 30, <span class="boxpink">     </span>);
		</pre>
		
		<h2><img src=" ">
		Step 3: CRAZY face!</h2>
		<p class="objective">
			See the first call to ellipse(), the one that currently says ellipse(200, 200, 200, 200)? This one 
			draws the outline of the face. Move it around by changing the first two numbers and change the size 
			by changing the last two numbers. Go CRAZY!
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
ellipse(<span class="boxorange">     </span>, <span class="boxpink">     </span>, <span class="boxblue">     </span>, <span class="boxred">     </span>);

		<h1><i class="fa fa-rocket fa-3x"></i> Project: Crazy Painter</h1>
		<p class="objective">
			You just learnt how to draw shapes under your mouse. Now test your creativity by making the craziest 
			painting program you can. <br><br>
			Experiment with using mouseX and mouseY with the shape commands, fill(), and stroke(). Change their 
			sizes and colors. Check out the documentation for each to get ideas of what you can do. There are 
			some secret extra parameters! <br><br>
			If you use your painter to make a beautiful painting, you could <a href="http://www.take-a-screenshot.org/"><span class="boxchange">screenshot it</span></a>
			and email or print the screenshot. <br><br>
			After writing code for your project, please request an evaluation to get points. <br>
			These evaluations will be public, so that we can all learn from each other.
		</p>

		<h3>Starting code: </h3>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
noStroke();
var draw = function() {
    fill(mouseX, 0, 0);
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 10, 10);
};
		</pre>

		<h1><i class="fa fa-star-o fa-3x"></i> Challenge: Parting Clouds</h1>
		<p class="objective">
			Animate clouds moving away from a growing sun!
		</p>
		
		<h2>Step 1: Cover the sun!</h2>
		<p class ="objective">
			Let's start off with the clouds covering the sun, so that we can animate them moving away from it. 
			Change the leftX and rightX variables so that the clouds cover the sun, but still let a little sun 
			peek out.
		</p> 
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var leftX = ___;
var rightX = ___;
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Step 2: Part the clouds!</h2>
		<p class ="objective">
			The clouds are hiding the sun now, and we want to animate them moving in opposite directions away 
			from it. Make it so that the left cloud moves 1 pixel to the left in each frame, and the right cloud 
			moves 1 pixel to the right. Remember you can click Restart to re-run your program.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
___ -= ___;
___ += ___;
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Step 3: Grow the sun!</h2>
		<p class="objective">
			Let's make it so the clouds are running away from a sun that's getting bigger and BIGGER. 
			Increment the sun radius by 2 pixels in each frame.

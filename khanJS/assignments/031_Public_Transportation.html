		<h1><i class="fa fa-rocket fa-3x"></i>Spin-off of "Project: Public Transportation"</h1>
		<p class="objective">
			In the animation challenges, you learned how to animate shapes over time. Now, use that knowledge to 
			animate your favorite form of public transportation. <br><br>
			Start by brainstorming a few modes of transportation, maybe on paper. When you've picked one, draw the 
			shapes for the form of public transportation you're animating. The starter code is just a wheel, you should 
			add much more to that! <br><br>
			Make sure you use xPos to animate it. Public transportation isn't so useful when it doesn't move!<br><br>
			After writing code for your project, please request an evaluation to get points.<br>
			These evaluations will be public, so that we can all learn from each other.
		</p>
		<h3>Starting code: </h3>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var xPos = 10; // start position

var draw = function() {
    background(255, 255, 255);
    line(0, 215, 400, 215);
    fill(0, 0, 0);
    ellipse(xPos, 200, 30, 30); // a wheel
    fill(255, 255, 255);
    ellipse(xPos, 200, 10, 10);
    xPos += 1;
};

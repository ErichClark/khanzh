		<h1><i class="fa fa-rocket fa-3x"></i> Spin-off of "Bonus Project: Custom Clothing"</h1>
		<p class="objective">
			Already designed an animal in the last project? Feel free to skip this project and go on to the next section. <br><br>
			Imagine you're buying a piece of clothing online, like a shirt or shoes. You often get to customize aspects of it, like the size 
			or color. Now, we want you to code a piece of clothing that can be customized entirely by variables. <br><br>
			Start by brainstorming what sort of clothing you want to draw, and what aspects of it you might customize with variables. Then 
			edit the code below, using shapes, fill, and stroke to draw the clothing. Try changing the variables to see how the clothing changes in response. <br><br>
			When you're all done, maybe you can sell your clothing to your friends and family! :-)
		</p>

		<p class ="objective">
			Starting code:
		</p> 
		<pre class="prettyprint">
// define variables
var clothingColor = color(162, 255, 125);
var clothingSize = 30;

// draw it, using those variables
fill(clothingColor);
rect(20, 20, clothingSize, clothingSize*10);
		</pre>

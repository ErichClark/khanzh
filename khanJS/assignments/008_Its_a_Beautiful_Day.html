		<h1><i class="fa fa-star-o fa-3x"></i>Challenge: It's a Beautiful Day</h1>
		<p class="objective">
			Take an ugly black and white drawing and turn it into a beautiful day! Use fill and paint with 
			all the colors of the wind!
		</p>
		
		<h2>Step 1: Color the sky!</h2>
		<p class ="objective">
			Start off by using the background command to color the sky! Use any color you want, but maybe blue?
		</p> 
		<pre class="prettyprint">
background(___, ___, ___);
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Step 2: Clouds don't have outlines!</h2>
		<p class ="objective">
			Let's get rid of the ugly outlines on 
			those shapes! Writing the command noStroke() 
			will tell the program to no longer draw the outlines.<br>
			Remember, noStroke() only affects shapes drawn afterwards. 
			Can you move noStroke() so that no shape has an outline? 
			The best place is probably at the very top of your program, 
			since we don't want outlines around *anything*.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
noStroke();
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Step 3: Color the grass!</h2>
		<p class="objective">
			Add a fill command to make the grass green. Remember that you'll 
			need the fill command to be *before* the command that draws the grass. 
			Don't worry if other shapes get colored too, we'll fix them later!
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
fill(___, ___, ___);
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Step 4: The sun should be a different color than the grass!</h2>
		<p class="objective">
			Now, add another fill() command to make the sun its own color, 
			maybe a bright orange or yellow. Don't worry if it colors the clouds, 
			too, those are next! <br>You'll need another call to fill to make the sun a different color!
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
fill(___, ___, ___);
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Step 5: Uh oh, what about the clouds!?</h2>
		<p class="objective">
			How about making the clouds a nice color like white or gray 
			or black? You should make all three parts of the cloud *one 
			color*, not three different colors, so you only need to add 
			one more fill() command.<br>You'll need another call to fill 
			to make the clouds a different color!
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
fill(___, ___, ___);
		</pre>

		<h1><i class="fa fa-rocket fa-3x"></i>Project: Fish Tank</h1>
		<p class="objective">
			This program draws a single fish. Poor lonely fish! For this project, you'll use functions to accompany him with more fish of all different shapes and colors.
			<br>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a custom function (like drawFish) that draws a fish at a given x and y with a given length, height, and color (5 parameters), using the starter code. <br>
				</li>
			<li>Call that function to draw the fish.  <br>
				</li>
			<li>Now call that function lots more times, with different values, so your screen is filled with fish. <br>
				</li>
			<li>Add more parameters to the function, like tail width, eye size, tail color - more ways that you can make each fish different from each other. <br>
				</li>
			<li>Bonus: Add seaweed to the tank, and make a function to draw it at different places and heights. Or add pebbles to the bottom. Or a bubble drawing function. <br>
				</li>
			<li>Bonus: Want to make it interactive? Use a mouseClicked function to add more fish wherever the user clicks. <br>
				</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p class="objective">
				Don't like fish? You could also make a pet shop, maybe using your animal code from the Design-an-Animal project, or a car shop, using rectangles. The important thing is to use functions to make your drawing code reusable.

		<h1><i class="fa fa-star fa-3x"></i>Quiz: Variable Expressions</h1>

		<h3>Question 1</h3>
		<p class="objective">This program draws a rectangle based on the variables w (for width) and h (for height):</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var w = 10;
var h = 50;
rect(200, 200, w, h);</pre>
		<p class="objective">Let's say we want to make h dependent on w, so that if we ever change the value of w, the value of h will change proportionately, so that h is always 5 times as large as w. What expression should h hold?</p>
		<p>
			<small><span title="To make h dependent on w, we need to use w somewhere in the expression."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Since h is currently 50 and w is 10, that means that h is 5 times value of w."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Thus, h should store w*5. For example, if we changed w to 3, then h would be 15."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>

		<h3>Question 2</h3>
		<p class="objective">Let's say we have a program that draws an ice cream cone (a triangle) with two scoops of ice cream (two ellipses) on top of it. The second scoop is slightly smaller than the first, and we have two variables, scoop1 and scoop2, to keep track of the scoop sizes:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var scoop1 = 40;
var scoop2 = 30;
triangle(200, 250, 180, 200, 220, 200);
ellipse(200, 180, scoop1, scoop1);
ellipse(200, 145, scoop2, scoop2);	</pre>
		<p class="objective">If we want to make scoop2 dependent on scoop1, so that scoop2 is always 10 pixels smaller than scoop1, what expression should we store in the scoop2 variable?</p>
		<p>
			<small><span title="To make scoop2 dependent on scoop1, we need to use scoop1 somewhere in the expression"><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="We know that scoop2 has to be 10 pixels LESS than scoop1, so our expression should use subtraction, not multiplication or addition."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Thus, scoop2 should store scoop1 - 10. If we changed scoop1 to 25 after that, then scoop2 would be 15 - exactly 10 pixels less."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>

		<h3>Question 3</h3>
		<p class="objective">After running this code:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var xPos = 10;
var yPos = 5;

rect(xPos, yPos, 10, 10); </pre>
		<p class="objective">What x position will the rectangle be at?</p>
		<p>
			<small><span title="The x position of the rectangle is determined by the value of the first parameter."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The xPos variable was passed as the first parameter to the rect command, so the x position will be whatever value xPos was assigned to."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The xPos variable was assigned to the value 10, and then passed as the first parameter to the rect command, so the rectangle's x position will be 10."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Question 4</h3>
		<p class="objective">The following program draws two boxes, a big one and a small one. The variables big and small keep track of the sizes of the two boxes:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var big = 100;
var small = 10;
rect(100, 100, big, big);
rect(100, 100, small, small);</pre>
		<p class="objective">We want to make small dependent upon big, so that if we change big, small will change in this same proportion to it. Small should always be 1/10 the size of big. What expression should small store?</p>
		<p>
			<small><span title="To make small dependent on big, we need to use big somewhere in the expression."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Since big is currently 100 and small is 10, that means that small is 1/5 the value of big."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Thus, small should store big/10. If we changed big to 200 after that, then small would be 20 - 1/10 of big."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Question 5</h3>
		<p class="objective"> In this program, the value of b is dependent upon the value of a and the value of c is dependent upon the value of b: </p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var a = 25;
var b = a / 5;
var c = b + 30;
println(b + c);</pre>
		<p class="objective"> What will the above program print? </p>		
		<p>
			<small><span title="In this case, the println() statement will print out the numeric value of the expression it takes as an argument, so the answer will be a number."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="In this program, the value of b is dependent upon the value of a, so we can determine the value of b by dividing a's value by 5: 25/5 = 5."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="In this program, the value of c is dependent upon the value of b, so we can determine the value of c by adding 30 to b's value 5: 5 + 30 = 35."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 3rd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The program will print out the sum of the value of b and the value of c. This is equal to 5 + 35, or 40."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Question 6</h3>
		<p class="objective"> Imagine the following program that draws two rectangles. The variables width1 and width2 keep track of the widths of the two rectangles, and width2 is dependent on width1: </p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var width1 = 12;
var width2 = 2 * width1 + 5;
rect(50, 50, width1, 10);
rect(50, 80, width2, 10);</pre>
		<p class="objective"> If we change the value stored in width1 to 6 (we are editing the first line of code; not appending the code), what will be the numeric value of the expression stored in width2? </p>		
		<p>
			<small><span title="We know that width2 is dependent on width1, because width1 is used in the expression that width2 stores. Therefore, when the value of width1 changes, the value of width2 must also change."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Because the expression that width2 stores uses only multiplication and addition, when width1 gets smaller, width2 will get smaller as well."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="If we substitute the new value for width1 (6) into the expression that width2 stores, we get the mathematical expression 2∗6+5, which is equal to 12+5, or 17."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Question 7</h3>
		<p class="objective"> Let's say we have a program that draws a simple face and body with ellipses. It uses two variables, one for body size and one for face size: </p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var bodySize = 100;
var faceSize = 50;
ellipse(200, 200, bodySize, bodySize);
ellipse(200, 150, faceSize, faceSize);</pre>
		<p class="objective"> If we want to make faceSize dependent on bodySize, so that faceSize is always one-half bodySize, what expression should the faceSize variable store instead? </p>		
		<p>
			<small><span title="To make faceSize dependent on bodySize, we need to use bodySize somewhere in the expression."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Since faceSize is currently 50 and bodySize is 100, that means that faceSize is 1/2 the value of bodySize."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Thus, faceSize should store bodySize/2. If we changed bodySize to 200 after that, then faceSize would be 100 - just what we wanted."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>

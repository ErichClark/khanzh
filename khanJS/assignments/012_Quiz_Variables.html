		<h1><i class="fa fa-star fa-3x"></i>Quiz: Variables</h1>

		<h3>Question 1</h3>
		<p class="objective">After running this code:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var rectWidth = 20;
rect(10, 10, rectWidth, rectWidth);</pre>
		<p class="objective">How wide will the resulting rectangle be?</p>
		<p>
			<small><span title="The third parameter of the rect command determines the width of the rectangle."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The variable rectWidth was passed as the third parameter to each command, so the width will be whatever value rectWidth was assigned to."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The rectWidth variable was assigned to 20 at the top of the program."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 3rd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Since rectWidth was assigned to the value of 20, and rectWidth was passed as the third parameter, then the rectangle will be 20 pixels wide."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>
		</p>

		<h3>Question 2</h3>
		<p class="objective">After running this code:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var w = 20;
var h = 15;
rect(10, 10, w, h);
ellipse(10, 10, w, h);	</pre>
		<p class="objective">What will be the height of each of the two shapes?</p>
		<p>
			<small><span title="The shapes will be as tall as their height parameter. For both the rect and ellipse commands, the fourth parameter determines the height."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The h variable is passed as the fourth parameter to each of the commands, so the height of each shape will be whatever value the h variable was assigned to."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The h variable was assigned to the value 15 at the top of the program."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 3rd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Since h was assigned to 15, and h was passed as the fourth parameter to each command, then the shapes will be 15 pixels tall."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Question 3</h3>
		<p class="objective">After running this code:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var xPos = 10;
var yPos = 5;

rect(xPos, yPos, 10, 10); </pre>
		<p class="objective">What x position will the rectangle be at?</p>
		<p>
			<small><span title="The x position of the rectangle is determined by the value of the first parameter."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The xPos variable was passed as the first parameter to the rect command, so the x position will be whatever value xPos was assigned to."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The xPos variable was assigned to the value 10, and then passed as the first parameter to the rect command, so the rectangle's x position will be 10."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Question 4</h3>
		<p class="objective">After running this code:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var xPos = 55;
rect(10, 20, 30, 40);
ellipse(xPos, 20, 15, 30);
ellipse(xPos, 10, 20, 30);</pre>
		<p class="objective">What x position will the ellipse(s) be at?</p>
		<p>
			<small><span title="We are passing the variable xPos to the first argument of the ellipse commands, so the x position of the ellipses will be whatever value the xPos variable is assigned to."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="The xPos variable was assigned to the value 55 at the top of the program."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a 2nd hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="Since xPos was assigned to the value 55, and then xPos is passed as the first parameter to the ellipse commands, then the ellipses will be drawn at an x position of 55."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Question 5</h3>
		<p class="objective">After running this code:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var x = 5;</pre>
		<p class="objective">What is the value of x?</p>
				<p>
			<small><span title="The value of x will be whatever value was assigned to it."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for a hint!</span></small><br>
			<small><span title="x was assigned to the value of 5, so the value will be 5."><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Hover over me for the answer!</span></small>

		<h1><i class="fa fa-star-o fa-3x"></i>Challenge: Brown Bear Eyes</h1>
		<p class="objective">
			Use variables to control the size of this bear's eyes.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Step 1: Variable for pupils</h2>
		<p class ="objective">
			What a cute bear! We're going to use him to get a little practice with variables. First, notice that 
			the radius of the eyes is stored in a variable called eyeRadius, which has a value of 20. However, 
			the pupil radius (which is equal to eyeRadius/2) is computed inside each call to ellipse() for the 
			pupils. Create a new variable to store the size of the pupils (eyeRadius/2), and then use that variable 
			as the last two arguments to the ellipse() calls for the pupils.
		</p> 
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var <span class="boxorange">     </span> = eyeRadius/2;</pre>
		<p class ="objective">
			After you create the variable: Great--you've created the variable! Now you need to pass only that variable 
			into the last two arguments in the two calls to ellipse() for the pupils. Remember that the last two arguments 
			for ellipse() are the width and height of the ellipse.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
ellipse(centerX-30, centerY-20, <span class="boxorange">     </span>, <span class="boxorange">     </span>);
ellipse(centerX+30, centerY-20, <span class="boxorange">     </span>, <span class="boxorange">     </span>); 
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Step 2: Variable for y coordinate of eyes</h2>
		<p class ="objective">
			Now, notice that both eyes and both pupils have the same y coordinate: (centerY-20). However, this value is 
			also computed every time it is used, instead of being stored in a variable. Create a new variable to store 
			the expression (centerY-20), and then use that as the second argument (the y coordinate) in the two calls 
			to ellipse() for the eyes AND the two calls to ellipse() for the pupils.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var <span class="boxorange">     </span> = centerY-20; </pre>
		<p class ="objective">
			After you create the variable: Great--you've created the variable! Now you need to pass only that variable as the second argument in the two 
			calls to ellipse() for the eyes and the two calls to ellipse() for the pupils. Remember that the last two 
			arguments for ellipse() are the width and height of the ellipse.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
// eyes
ellipse(centerX-30, <span class="boxorange">     </span>, eyeRadius, eyeRadius);
ellipse(centerX+30, <span class="boxorange">     </span>, eyeRadius, eyeRadius);
//pupils
ellipse(centerX-30, <span class="boxorange">     </span>, <span class="boxpink">     </span>, <span class="boxpink">     </span>);
ellipse(centerX+30, <span class="boxorange">     </span>, <span class="boxpink">     </span>, <span class="boxpink">     </span>);
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Step 3: Play time!</h2>
		<p class="objective">
			Now that you've done the hard work, you can play around with the size of the pupils and the y coordinates of the eyes, 
			just by changing the values stored in the two new variables you have created. Feel free to change the size of the eyes 
			via eyeRadius as well. Remember there's no need to edit any calls to ellipse()!
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
var eyeRadius = ___;
var <span class="boxorange">     </span> = eyeRadius / ___;
var <span class="boxpink">     </span> = centerY - ___;
		</pre>
